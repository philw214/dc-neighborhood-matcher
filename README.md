# WhereWallet

WhereWallet is an app that helps users new to DC (or looking to move to a new neighborhood) see whether they have a sound budget for the lifestyle they envision. Users respond to a short series of questions about their income, housing preferences, and spending habits, and the app presents them with results about how much they will realistically spend in a year. 

To try out the app, go to wherewallet.herokuapp.com, or fork this repository and run it locally.
